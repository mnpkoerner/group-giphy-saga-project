## Project Description
For this project, my group and I were tasked with building an app that uses the Giphy API to allow a user to search for gifs, favorite them, and categorize them. The project utilizes React, Redux, Redux-Saga and integrates them with that 3rd party API. The biggest challenge was breaking the work out into reasonable chunks for each of use to separately complete, while trying to avoid bottlenecks and idly sitting waiting for bits to be completed. When there was the occasional bottleneck, we all jumped on a call to pair program a bit and work through what the issue / holdup might be.

## Development Setup Instructions
* Run `npm install`
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run server` to start the server
* Run `npm run client` to start the client
* Navigate to `localhost:3000`
